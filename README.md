# ML Sensors
This repository contains resources related to ML Sensors, a new paradigm for edge devices which segregates the sensor input data and ML processing from the wider system at the hardware level while providing a thin interface that mimics traditional sensors in functionality.

## Datasheet
This section describes the process of creating a Datasheet for an ML Sensor.

The markdown template is available [here](https://github.com/harvard-edge/ML-Sensor-Datasheet/blob/main/ML-Sensor-Datasheet-Template.md)
